NESTLE  29/8/12  10:30  Page 3  Nestlé actively seeks engagement and partnerships with external stakeholders to optimise positive impact. It aims to use the power of its core activities and partnerships for the joint benefit of the people in the countries where it operates and of its shareholders. Global principles and goals set by organisations such as the United Nations also help to shape a company’s approach to corporate social responsibility. For example, Nestlé’s Corporate Business Principles incorporate the 10 United Nations Global Compact Principles on Human Rights, Labour, the Environment and Corruption. Nestlé is an active member of several of the Compact’s Working Groups and Initiatives. Creating Shared Value has become an integral part of the way in which Nestlé does business. It is based on compliance with international laws and codes of conduct, the company’s business principles and a focus on environmental sustainability. However, Creating Shared Value goes beyond compliance and sustainability. It aims to create new and greater value for society and shareholders in the areas where the company can have the biggest impact – nutrition, water and rural development. These are core to its business activities and vital for its value chain: • Water: because the ongoing quality and availability of it is critical to life, to the production of food and to Nestlé’s operations. • Rural development: because the overall well-being of farmers, rural communities, workers and small businesses and suppliers is intrinsic to the long-term success of Nestlé’s business. • Nutrition: because food and nutrition are the basis of health and of Nestlé’s business as the leading Nutrition, Health and Wellness company.  Creating Shared Value along the supply chain – The Nestlé Cocoa Plan Supply chain activities transform natural resources and raw materials into finished products which are delivered to the end consumer. Each stage of the process adds value to the overall end product.
